1、Run the program named "Machine Information.exe" on your target machine, and then take a screenshot or take a photo to save it as a picture.
2、Contact this person's QQ number: 1575819003, or contact this QQ group number: 924013995 or 423812702 to contact the salesperson.
3、Send the machine information in the form of screenshots or photos or text in step 1 and the package you selected to the personal QQ number in step 2.
4、Calculate the price of products and confirm with each other.
5、If the product is newly purchased, 200 Chinese yuan will be paid as a deposit to the WeChat collection code or Alipay collection code provided by the Group, and mutual confirmation will be made with the sales staff. If the product is upgraded, no deposit is required.
6、The salesperson will contact you and propose delivery within 24 hours. If you buy a new product, you need to pay the balance (total price minus deposit). If you buy an upgraded product, you should pay the corresponding amount, and confirm with the salesperson. After confirmation, the product will be sent to you on QQ.
7、If you buy a new product, you will get a serial number for subsequent possible upgrades. The serial number uniquely corresponds to the machine information you provided in step 3, otherwise it is invalid.
